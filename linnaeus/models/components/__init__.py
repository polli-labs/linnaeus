"""
Components Module
---------------

This module contains self-registering components that can be instantiated
through the model factory system.

# COMMENT: ProgressivePatchEmbed has been moved to blocks/ as the patch embed modules do not need to be user-facing, configurable components
# Instead ablations/experiments should be done in code (i.e. in model defns) rather than in configs
# COMMENT: Keeping this module around for now as there are other components that may be added in the future. Might even consider moving ProgressivePatchEmbed and OverlapPatchEmbed back here.

Available Components:
- NONE
