Your approach of deferring detailed documentation until your codebase matures is a pragmatic choice. Given the complexity and extensive functionality of your codebase, effective documentation must strike a balance between breadth (high-level overview) and depth (component-specific guides and API references). Here is a recommended structure and plan for your documentation, including rationale and best practices tailored to your project’s requirements.

Recommended Documentation Structure

I recommend structuring your documentation into a dedicated docs directory (separate from the main README). Typically, an effective structure might include:

linnaeus/
├── README.md
└── docs/
    ├── getting_started/
    │   ├── installation.md
    │   ├── quickstart_training.md
    │   └── quickstart_inference.md
    ├── user_guides/
    │   ├── training_pipeline_overview.md
    │   ├── dataset_preparation.md
    │   ├── augmentations.md
    │   ├── model_components_and_architecture.md
    │   ├── loss_functions_and_task_weighting.md
    │   ├── lr_scheduling_and_hyperparams.md
    │   ├── model_evaluation_and_logging.md
    │   └── inference_deployment.md
    ├── advanced_topics/
    │   ├── partial_masking_meta_functionality.md
    │   ├── full_factorial_validation.md
    │   └── custom_component_extensions.md
    ├── api_reference/
    │   ├── modules/
    │   │   ├── augmentation.md
    │   │   ├── cpu_augmentation.md
    │   │   └── gpu_augmentation.md
    │   ├── models.md
    │   ├── loss_functions.md
    │   ├── schedulers.md
    │   ├── utilities.md
    │   └── data_handling.md
    └── contributing.md

### Rationale for the Proposed Documentation Structure

- **Modularity:**  
  The complexity and breadth of your codebase require modular documentation. Distinct doc pages organized thematically provide clarity and facilitate navigation.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Keep README lightweight, providing an overview and essential quick references (installation, quickstart). Detailed component-specific and advanced topics belong in standalone guides.

- **User-Friendliness:**  
  Clearly structured, logically grouped sections facilitate quick onboarding and deep dives into individual components as necessary.

- **Future-proofing:**  
  Establishing a clear structure upfront helps ensure easy extension and maintenance as the project grows.

## Explanation of Each Section:

### 1. `README.md`  
This file provides a concise introduction and overview of your codebase. Key content includes:

- **Introduction:** Briefly state the purpose and main goals of your repository.
- **Core capabilities:** Summarize the main functionalities.
- **Quickstart:** Briefly introduce links to setup and quickstart instructions for training and deployment.
- **Docs Table of Contents:** A quick reference linking to various documentation sections.

Example Table of Contents:
```markdown
## Table of Contents
- [Installation](docs/installation.md)
- [Quickstart: Training](docs/quickstart_training.md)
- [Quickstart: Inference](docs/quickstart_inference.md)
- [User Guides](docs/user_guides/)
- [Advanced Topics](docs/advanced_topics/)
- [API Reference](docs/api_reference/)
- [Contributing](docs/contributing.md)



⸻

2. Quickstarts

installation.md

Explain how to set up the development and deployment environments. Describe dependencies, environments, and reproducibility practices.

quickstart_training.md

Briefly describe how to quickly run a training job:
	•	Example commands
	•	Configuring YAML files
	•	Where to find outputs/checkpoints/logs

quickstart_inference.md

Briefly describe how to deploy models for inference:
	•	TorchServe usage example
	•	Standalone inference code example

⸻

2. User Guides (Comprehensive explanations & tutorials)

Cover essential concepts and workflows, with detailed explanations and clear examples:
	•	training_pipeline_overview.md:
Explain pipeline workflow, including configuration-driven architecture building, multitask training, and logging.
	•	dataset_preparation.md
Instructions on preparing datasets, formats (h5data), synthetic datasets, preprocessing pipelines.
	•	inference_deployment.md
Detailed inference and serving strategies (TorchServe handlers, standalone options).

⸻

3. advanced_topics/
	•	partial_masking_meta_functionality.md
Detailed coverage of the partial masking meta-functionality, motivations, applications, training implications, and best practices.
	•	full_factorial_validation.md
Guide on running robustness validations using factorial combinations of meta features—describing why this is beneficial and how to interpret results.
	•	custom_component_extensions.md
Explanation on extending/adding new augmentations, attention modules, loss functions, and integration points.

⸻

4. api_reference/

Auto-generated or manually maintained reference describing core APIs:
	•	Class constructors and methods
	•	Configurations and parameters
	•	Functions and their expected inputs/outputs

Clearly state which APIs you anticipate stability for and which may still change rapidly.

⸻

5. contributing.md

Encourage best practices, formatting, testing standards, and guidelines for future contributors (even if currently one-person).

Recommended Implementation Steps:
	1.	Initial README Update (High Priority):
	•	Briefly overview the project, key features, and mention upcoming documentation.
	•	Set the tone for users/developers: where documentation will live, expectations, etc.
	•	Clearly communicate what is available today and what is in development.
	2.	Placeholder Documentation Creation:
	•	Immediately create placeholders for each outlined docpage above.
	•	Populate empty markdown files with simple headers and brief summaries outlining future content to set expectations clearly.
	3.	Documentation Expansion (Iterative):
	•	Gradually fill out user guides, prioritizing the most stable and mature components.
	•	Begin writing sections immediately relevant to user onboarding (quickstarts) and developer orientation (high-level training/inference guides).
	•	Maintain a lightweight backlog to track unwritten documentation topics.
	4.	Automated API Reference (Medium Priority):
	•	Consider using automated documentation tools (e.g., Sphinx with autodoc, mkdocs) to auto-generate API documentation from docstrings. Given your preference for generous self-documentation, this is an efficient path to comprehensive reference documentation.
	5.	Versioned Documentation (Long-term):
	•	As models evolve (mFormerV0, mFormerV1, etc.), versioned documentation could be beneficial.
	•	This allows documentation to match specific model versions for clarity and maintainability.
