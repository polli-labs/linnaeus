# Model Zoo

The Polli Linnaeus Model Zoo provides access to pre-trained models for taxonomic classification. These models can be used for direct inference or as a basis for further research and fine-tuning. Our initial set of models focuses on North American taxa, built using the `mFormerV1_sm` architecture.

All models listed below are scheduled for release on Hugging Face Hub (under `polli-caleb/linnaeus`) in early July. Links will be updated upon release.
